### What

A chrome extension to help facilitate the viewing of URLs in different environments.  It's not very customizable at the moment and is very tailored to my specific needs at homes.com.

### Why

I get a lot of URLS sent to me (often in relative form) via webmail or issue tracking software and I am tired of having to type my host name in or modify the URL in order to try it in different environments.

### Current Features

A context menu exists that allows you to choose the environment in which to open any relative or full URL.  It will trim out any white space on the ends of the selection, and also splice out any host names if the URL is complete.


### Future Features?

* Keyboard shortcuts
* Using the contents of the address bar as the selection

### How

1. Download the source or clone the repo
2. Open the extensions section in Chrome
3. Turn on developer mode
4. Click the add unpacked extension button and select the source you downloaded 
5. Select options on the extension and enter your ontime subdomain
6. Right click a selected id and click your new menu item (will also support ids prefixed with ot)
